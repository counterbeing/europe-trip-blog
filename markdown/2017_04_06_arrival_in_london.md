The beginning of the trip was a bit of a blur. I'd only just finished pizza and a glass of bourbon with a few close friends when the car to the airport arrived unexpectedly early.

I grabbed some abbreviated hugs, with the overwhelming sense that I'd forgotten something â€“ but what could it have been?

Walk. Wait. Check in. Gate wait. Plane. Wait. Iceland waiting. More plain waiting. And that was it. I had arrived.

I got the third degree from immigration. She asked all sorts of invasive questions. How long was I staying? How much money had I brought with me? How much money did I have in the bank? Would I be working? And what the hell was I doing here? After some very skeptical looks, she stamped my passport and let me in.
